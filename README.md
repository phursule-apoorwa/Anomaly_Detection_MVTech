# Anomaly_Detection_MVTech

Anomaly detection is like spotting an outlier or an odd behavior in a dataset. 
Using the MVTec AD dataset’s various categories, we evaluated three models’ effectiveness in detecting manufacturing defects.
The models used were a memory-based PatchCore model utilizing Vision Transformers (ViT), a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and a traditional VGG16-based CNN model.
